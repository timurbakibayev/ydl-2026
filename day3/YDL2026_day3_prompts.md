# Часть 1 · Titanic — те же вопросы, теперь картинками

**0.**
```
Load the built-in "titanic" dataset from seaborn, set up matplotlib and seaborn for clean inline plots, and show head().
```

## Ответы вчерашних вопросов — визуально

**1.**
```
Show how many survived vs died as a bar chart. Give the chart a title that states the conclusion, not the topic.
```

**2.**
```
Show the survival rate of men vs women as a bar chart. Title it with the takeaway.
```

**3.**
```
Show the survival rate by passenger class as a bar chart, sorted, with a conclusion title.
```

**4.**
```
Show the distribution of passenger age as a histogram. What shape does it have?
```

**5.**
```
Show the distribution of fare as a histogram. Point out what looks unusual in the shape.
```

## Где один график говорит больше числа

**6.**
```
Plot the age distribution of survivors vs non-survivors on the same chart. Does age matter?
```

**7.**
```
Show fare by passenger class as a box plot. What does it reveal that a single average per class would hide?
```

**8.**
```
What is the average fare? Now show the full fare distribution. Does that single number describe the data well?
```

**9.**
```
Show survival by class and sex together as grouped bars. Which single group stands out?
```

**10.**
```
Make a scatter plot of age vs fare, colored by survived. Is there any visible pattern?
```

**11.**
```
Make a heatmap of survival rate with class on one axis and sex on the other.
```

## Приёмы рассказчика

**12.**
```
Take the survival-rate-by-class chart and rewrite its title so it states the conclusion in plain words.
```

**13.**
```
In the survival-by-class chart, gray out every bar except the one that matters most, and highlight that one in color.
```

**14.**
```
Show survival rate by class as small multiples: one panel per sex, side by side. What pattern appears?
```

**15.**
```
Build a 3-chart story that leads a reader to one clear conclusion about who survived the Titanic. Each chart's title should be its point.

# Часть 2 · 911 — Montgomery County

**16.**
```
Load the 911 calls dataset from 911.csv into df. Show shape, head, columns and dtypes.
```

**17.**
```
The title column looks like "EMS: BACK PAINS/INJURY". Create a new column "reason" with just the part before the colon (EMS / Fire / Traffic). Show value_counts.
```

**18.**
```
Parse the timeStamp column into a real datetime, then add columns for hour, day of week, month, and date.
```

## Вопросы к данным — картинками

**19.**
```
Which reason is most common — EMS, Fire or Traffic? Show it as a bar chart with a conclusion title.
```

**20.**
```
Show the number of calls per month over the whole period as a line. Describe the trend.
```

**21.**
```
Show the number of calls by hour of the day. When do 911 calls peak?
```

**22.**
```
Show the number of calls by day of the week, ordered Monday to Sunday.
```

**23.**
```
Show the top 10 specific call types (the full title) as a horizontal bar chart.
```

**24.**
```
Show the top 10 townships by number of calls as a horizontal bar chart.
```

## Истории, которые видно только глазами

**25.**
```
Make a heatmap with hour of day on one axis and day of week on the other, showing call volume. Where are the hot spots?
```

**26.**
```
Plot calls by hour of day as one line per reason (EMS, Fire, Traffic) on the same chart. Do they peak at different times?
```

**27.**
```
Plot every call as a point on lng (x) vs lat (y), colored by reason. What does the shape of the county look like?
```

**28.**
```
Show the monthly trend as one line per reason. Are they all growing the same way?
```

**29.**
```
What is the average number of calls per day as a single number? Now plot daily call counts over the whole period. Does the average describe it well?
```

**30.**
```
Find the single busiest day in the data. Plot that day's calls by hour, and look at what call types spiked — what likely happened?
```

## Приёмы рассказчика на 911

**31.**
```
On the calls-by-hour chart, mark and label the peak hour directly on the plot with an arrow or annotation.
```

**32.**
```
In the calls-by-day-of-week chart, highlight Traffic in color and gray out the rest. What stands out?
```

**33.**
```
Show the hourly pattern of Traffic calls vs EMS calls overlaid. Tell the rush-hour story in one chart with a conclusion title.
```

## Кульминация

**34.**
```
Many people assume Fire calls are the most common 911 emergency. Build 2-3 charts that show what is actually most common and how Fire really compares.
```

**35.**
```
Build a 4-5 chart visual story that leads a reader to one clear insight about 911 calls in this county. Each chart titled with its point, ending on the strongest one.
```

## Резерв

**36.**
```
Is total call volume growing month over month? Show the percent change between the first full month and the last.
```

**37.**
```
Which township has the highest SHARE of Traffic calls (not just the highest count)? Show the top 10 as a bar chart.
```

**38.**
```
Make a heatmap of townships (top 15) vs reason, showing the number of calls in each combination.
```

**39.**
```
Split the day into morning, afternoon, evening, night and show how the mix of reasons changes across them.

# Часть 3 · tips — кто хорошо даёт чаевые

**40.**
```
Load the built-in "tips" dataset from seaborn. Show head and dtypes.
```

**41.**
```
Make a scatter plot of total_bill vs tip. Does a bigger bill mean a bigger tip? Give it a conclusion title.
```

**42.**
```
Create a tip_pct column = tip / total_bill * 100. Show its distribution as a histogram.
```

**43.**
```
Show the average tip percent by day of the week as a bar chart, with a conclusion title.
```

**44.**
```
Show the average tip percent for smokers vs non-smokers. Is the difference real, or tiny? Keep the y-axis honest (start at zero).
```

```
Show the average tip percent by party size. What is the surprising pattern?
```

**46.**
```
Box plot of tip percent for lunch vs dinner.

**47.**
```
In the tip-percent-by-party-size chart, color the solo-diner bar and gray out the rest. State the takeaway in the title.
```

**48.**
```
People assume bigger groups tip more generously. Build 2 charts that test this using tip PERCENT, not the total tip amount. What do they show?
```

**49.**
```
Build a 3-chart story answering "who tips well and who doesn't?", ending on the strongest finding. Each title is its point.

# Часть 4 · flights — данные во времени

**50.**
```
Load the built-in "flights" dataset from seaborn. Show head and explain what one row means.
```

**51.**
```
Plot total passengers per month over the whole period as a single line. Describe the shape.
```

**52.**
```
That line has two things happening at once. Separate them: one chart of the long-term trend (per year) and one of the within-year seasonal pattern (per month).
```

**53.**
```
Plot one line per year with month on the x-axis, all on one chart. What repeats every single year?
```
